# ‚öîÔ∏è Turn-Based Tactics RPG ‚Äî Project Phases

## üéØ Project Vision

A story-driven, single-player, turn-based tactics RPG with rich narrative, character growth, and exploration. Players will travel through a connected world (inspired by Dragon Quest), battle visible enemies, and unlock class-based abilities that can be carried across builds. The game will feature a 2.5D pixel art style and be developed for eventual release on Steam.

## Phase 1: üéÆ Vertical Slice Demo (DQ1 Scope)

**Core Goal:**  
Build a polished, small-scale playable demo that includes exploration, visible enemies, turn-based combat, basic dialogue, and a few connected maps ‚Äî playable start to finish in 1‚Äì2 hours.

- [ ] Add rudimentary UI (HP display, action buttons)
- [ ] Build a dialogue system triggered by events/NPCs
- [ ] Add static map transitions (e.g. between village, forest, dungeon)
- [ ] Create a demo area with 2‚Äì3 connected maps and 3+ enemy types

## Phase 2: üìö Narrative and System Expansion

**Core Goal:**  
Lay the groundwork for long-form storytelling and early game scaling. Focus on adding support for branching dialogue, early quests, and persistent state between maps.

## Phase 3: üß† Class & Ability Depth

**Core Goal:**  
Introduce more tactical complexity: class switching, skill inheritance, and unit loadouts.

**Key Objectives:**
- [ ] Implement a class system with stat growth and equipable abilities
- [ ] Create UI for viewing/managing learned abilities
- [ ] Allow learned abilities to be equipped across compatible classes
- [ ] Add a system for ability acquisition (e.g. via leveling, story events, trainers)
- [ ] Expand unit behavior in combat (AI logic, priority targeting)
- [ ] Add enemy variants that force ability and strategy variation

## Phase 4: üåç World Building & Full Loop

**Core Goal:**  
Support a full-game loop: world progression, save/load, multiple story arcs, NPCs, and non-combat gameplay.

**Key Objectives:**
- [ ] Add save/load system with slot support
- [ ] Implement fast travel / map navigation system
- [ ] Add towns with shops, inns, and flavor NPCs
- [ ] Add puzzle or non-combat exploration mechanics
- [ ] Build more maps: overworld routes, multiple dungeons, unique regions
- [ ] Support optional content: hidden areas, optional bosses, side quests

## Phase 5: üöÄ Polish & Steam Release

**Core Goal:**  
Finalize the game with polish, QA, and platform prep for Steam distribution.

**Key Objectives:**
- [ ] Replace placeholder assets with finalized art/music (created or refined manually)
- [ ] Add polish animations, sound design, and transitions
- [ ] Optimize performance and memory usage
- [ ] Integrate Steam SDK (achievements, save sync)
- [ ] Package game for distribution (build system, resolution settings, etc.)
- [ ] Write store page, trailer, screenshots, and marketing material

## Notes:
- Art and music assets will be bootstrapped with AI tools early and replaced as the developer's personal skill improves.
- Phase boundaries are flexible. Tasks may shift or be revisited as new ideas arise during development.
